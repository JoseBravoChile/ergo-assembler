# Transaction Assembler Service for [ERGO](https://ergoplatform.org/en/)
A service to be used for bypassing node requirement of dApps on Ergo.
See [this](https://www.ergoforum.org/t/tx-assembler-service-bypassing-node-requirement-for-dapps/443)
for more technical details.

## WHY?
dApp developers need some kind of bridge to access user's assets in a secure manner.
For example, the [Ergo Auction House](http://ergoauctions.org) needs to use user's funds 
to place bid on user's desired auction. That kind of secure access is possible through some sort of wallet APIs;
For example, Yoroi wallet
has plans to add support for such [bridge between the wallet and dApps](https://cardanoupdates.com/docs/98524716-9e4c-4aeb-b462-08ec701b7f6c). However, that may take some time, also, from the
decentralization perspective, it is good to have alternative options!

By using this service, it is possible to generate any arbitrary transaction on user's behalf while letting user to use her favorite wallet!
